# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Analysis
🧠 Project Overview: Titanic Survival Prediction & Analysis
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover key survival patterns and build predictive models that can help answer the following real-world questions:

💡 What factors significantly influenced survival?

📊 Did socioeconomic status affect survival rates?

🚸 Were women and children prioritized during evacuation?

The final deliverable is a Streamlit-based web app that lets users interactively input passenger details, visualize prediction outcomes, and compare model performance using ROC curves.

🔍 Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handle missing values and outliers

Understand age, fare, class, and family distributions

Build & Evaluate Predictive Models

Logistic Regression: for interpretability and statistical insight

Decision Tree: for visual decision-making and non-linear patterns

Deploy an Interactive Dashboard

Use Streamlit to create a UI for predictions

Compare model performance visually using ROC curves

Export predictions as CSV for further use

📊 Key Insights
Sex was the most influential factor: Females had ~4× greater odds of survival

Pclass showed that higher-class passengers had better outcomes

Age mattered: Younger passengers were more likely to survive

Large families had lower odds of survival compared to solo or small-family travelers

💡 Why This Project Matters
This project isn't just about predicting outcomes from historical data—it's about learning from the past to:

Build smarter safety protocols

Inform evacuation planning

Improve resource distribution during emergencies

The same techniques used here can be applied to modern transportation safety, disaster planning, and humanitarian logistics.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for EDA visualization

Scikit-learn for model building

Streamlit for web app deployment
